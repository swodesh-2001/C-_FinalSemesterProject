# C++ FinalSemesterProject

**This is final semester project for Object Oriented Programming, BE 3rd semester ELectrical Engineering. Our goal of this project is to combine the overall knowledge of OOP that we gain in this semester and implement it to create a working practical program, for this project we have made a simple painting program where we can draw different artworks. It is a drawing application where we can create different artworks simply playing around with the tools like rectangle, triangle, square, pen tool etc. The project utilizes GLUT library to create interactive GUI.


Download all the files of the main branch and open the exe files to run.
If error occurs then please try to run this code seperately in any IDE .

Once the paint app opens you will be given with instruction if you click any objects from menu bar**
                                      
                                      **THANKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!**
